	Write a function that sorts the list passed as an parameter, using the function pointer cmp to sort the list depending on the function (increasing/decreasing). Function passed as cmp, if a<b return a value â‰  0 else return 0
	Testing this function is also pretty hard.
	The function passed in argument does not need to be defined in the code.
